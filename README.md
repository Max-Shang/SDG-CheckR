# SDG-CheckR
This App automatically checks the data quality for SDG data. 
To use the App, you just need to upload the data. All the check will be done automatically with the results displayed on the right side of your screen. Most of the time, the results will show up instantly. For some files, the App will take longer time to finish all the calculation and you may need to wait for the results.
